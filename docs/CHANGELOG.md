## [Session 1 Certification — DEMO Cleanup & Bootstrap Gating] — 2026-08-05

### Security / Fail-Closed (Repository-wide)
*   **DB fallback now fails closed**: `apps/api/src/db/client.ts` no longer silently falls back to an in-memory demo DB (seeded with a demo super admin `admin@windels.ai`, demo org, and 5 demo AI agents) when real-Prisma/Postgres init fails. Production DB failure now aborts startup. The in-memory fallback is available only when `WINDELS_ALLOW_MOCK_DB_FALLBACK=true` **and** `NODE_ENV !== production` (new env flag, default false).
*   **CSPRNG hardening**: API-key generation (`services/apikey.service.ts`), invoice-number randomness (`services/billing.service.ts`), and observability trace/span ids (`http/middleware/observability.ts`) replaced `Math.random()` with `node:crypto` `randomBytes`.

### Demo Data Gating (Production starts empty)
*   Bootstraps that directly seeded business/reference records are now gated behind `WINDELS_DEMO_DATA` (off by default): `release`, `program`, `devportal`, `qa`, and `enterprise/agentComm`. Production deployments will not auto-create fake release history, programs, SDK catalogs, reference suites, or default teams/policies.

### Tests / Guards
*   New `apps/api/src/demoCleanup.guard.test.ts` (7 tests) pins the fail-closed and demo-gating behavior; includes a repo-wide scan asserting every directly-seeding bootstrap is gated.
*   Full API suite: **933 tests passing, 0 failures**.

## [v2.0.0-staging] — 2026-07-30

### Added
*   **Version 2 Enterprise Documentation Suite**: Comprehensive documentation covering system design, AI architectures, multi-tenant databases, scaling, disaster recovery, and API standards.
*   **Session 83 ETL & Ingestion**: Pipeline builder UI layouts, SFTP/S3 connectors, custom Zod validators, and a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
*   **Session 87 Camera Intelligence**: RTSP feed registry, WebRTC sessions, real-time computer vision models (PPE, License Plate, and Intrusion), and secure incident timelines.
*   **Cross-Platform Integrations**: Standard React views for Desktop and Mobile PWA environments.

### Fixed
*   **Logger Call Mismatch**: Standardized Pino logger parameters.
*   **Vector Storage Imports**: Resolved broken relative path definitions.
*   **Benchmarks Properties**: Corrected scoring reference variables.
